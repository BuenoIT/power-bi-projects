# Power BI Dashboards

In this GitHub repository, you will find my collection of Power BI projects. I have included various reports, dashboards, datasets, and supporting files that demonstrate my skills and experience with the Power BI tool.

The repository is organized into different folders, each containing related projects or resources. For example, one folder might contain sales reports for a particular department, while another folder might contain customer analysis reports.

Each project folder includes a Power BI report file (.pbix) and any supporting files that are required to run the report, such as data source files or custom visuals. I have also included documentation files, such as READMEs or user manuals, to help you understand how to use and customize the reports.
